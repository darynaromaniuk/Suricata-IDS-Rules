# Suricata-IDS-Rules

# Objective
In this lab, I successfully configured Suricata on a firewall machine to monitor network traffic actively. I created custom rules to detect HTTP and UDP traffic, learned about rule priorities, and classified alerts using the classtype meta keyword. This experience enhanced my understanding of network security and intrusion detection systems.

# Skills Learned
- **Suricata Installation and Configuration:** Gained hands-on experience in installing and configuring Suricata on a firewall.

- **Rule Creation:** Learned how to create and manage custom rules in Suricata for traffic detection.

- **Traffic Monitoring and Log Investigation**: Developed skills in monitoring network traffic and interpreting log files to identify suspicious activity.

  # Steps

**1. SSH into the Firewall**
     
  **2.Created Custom Rule File**

  I created an empty rule file in the Suricata rules directory:

**File Location:** /etc/suricata/rules/custom.rules
**Command:**

**3. Modify Suricata Configuration**
Next, I modified the Suricata configuration file located at _/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml_:

Changed the default-rule-path value to_ /etc/suricata/rules._
Included the custom.rules file in the rule-files list.

**5. Investigated the Logs:**

I monitored the log file at /var/log/suricata/fast.log to verify the alerts generated by the rules:

**tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log**

**6. Rule Priority**
I noted that the default priority for alerts when not specified is 3.

**7. Adding Meta Keywords**
I extended my rules to include the classtype meta keyword to classify alerts. The following rules were added:
